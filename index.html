        <h2>Welcome to RoboCare</h2>
        <p>Providing spare parts for retired robots.</p>

	<h3>Welcome to RoboCare</h3>
	At RoboCare, we specialize in breathing new life into retired robots. Our mission is to provide high-quality spare parts for a variety of robot models, ensuring they continue to function effectively and efficiently, long after their standard service period has ended.
	<h5>Our Journey</h5>
	Founded in 2020 by a group of robotics enthusiasts and engineers, RoboCare started as a small workshop dedicated to the restoration and maintenance of classic robot models. We quickly realized that many robot owners faced challenges in finding parts and technical support for their retired mechanical companions. This inspired us to expand our services, and today, we are proud to be the leading provider of spare parts for retired robots.
